## The website of Isaac Leonard v 2.0

The first version of this site was done in hand coded HTML, which, while instructive, was a somewhat tedious.

Now I am using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) generate HTML from markdown + templates.

The analog report from the S3 logs is available [here](/meta/analog.html).
