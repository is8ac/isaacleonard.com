This page is contains information about the person Isaac Leonard.
For information about this website see [/meta](/meta)

I live in Oregon with my two goats and study Haskell, Python, R, and HTML.

Additionally, I make [pretty pictures](https://github.com/is8ac/network-gen)
with R and [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

I spent a year working at the University of Oregon researching the effects
of *dnmt1* and background on *mef2ca<sup>-</sup>* zebra fish craniofacial cartilage development.

I try to be a <a href="http://lesswrong.com/">rationalist</a>.

If we are
[sufficiently  similar](http://lesswrong.com/lw/tn/the_true_prisoners_dilemma/),
[contact me](/contact).
