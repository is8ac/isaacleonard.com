Until now, `isaacleonard.com` has been hand coded HTML, which, while instructive, was somewhat tedious to create.

That is now come to and end, as I switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator.

I get all the advantages of a static site hosted on S3,
and also the simplicity of writing in Markdown.
