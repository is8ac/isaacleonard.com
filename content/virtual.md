# Network graphs
The igraph R package makes it easy to generate network graphs from various sources.

Anytime there is data of the form:

| thing1 | thing2 |
| :----: |:------:|
| foo    | quaks  |
| bar    | foo    |
| baz    | bar    |
| quaks  | foo    |

one can generate a network graph from it.
If the data is anything other then random, (and perhaps even then) it will make interesting pictures.
